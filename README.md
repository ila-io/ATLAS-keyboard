# ATLAS-keyboard

In exploring split keyboard layouts, I found that not many of them had all the keys that I wanted, and the ones that did had crazy layouts and sizes. I struck a balance between the two, minimizing the size of my keyboard by making it as low profile as possible and limiting it to only the keys that I wanted.
